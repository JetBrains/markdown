* First item
* second item

And there:

- First item

- Second Item

And here:

+ First item
+ Second Item

And nested ones?

* First item
    + An Item
    + An Item
* Second item
    One may note that this is not a code anymore,

        But this is still verbatim because of the indent of 8

        And after this EOL it is still a `code`
        <code> in code should be escaped as well

    But this is not, I suppose.
