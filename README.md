# intellij-markdown [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub) [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.jetbrains/markdown)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.jetbrains/markdown) [![IR](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin%2FJS-IR%20supported-yellow)](https://kotl.in/jsirsupported)

A multiplatform Markdown processor written in Kotlin.

## Introduction

[intellij-markdown][self] is an extensible Markdown processor written in Kotlin.
It aims to suit the following needs:
- Use one code base for both client and server-side processing
- Produce consistent output on different platforms
- Support different [Markdown flavours][markdown-flavours]
- Be easily extensible

The processor is written in pure [Kotlin] (with a little [flex][jflex]), so it can be compiled not only for the JVM target, but for JS and Native.
This allows for the processor to be used everywhere.

## Usage

### Adding `intellij-markdown` as a dependency

The library is hosted in the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.jetbrains/markdown), so to be able to use it, you need to configure the central repository:

```kts
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
```

If you have Gradle `>= 5.4`, you can just add the main artifact as a dependency: 

```kts
dependencies {
  implementation("org.jetbrains:markdown:0.6.1")
}
```

Gradle should resolve your target platform and decide which artifact (JVM or JS) to download.

For the multiplatform projects you can the single dependency to the `commonMain` class path:

```groovy
commonMain {
  dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains:markdown:0.6.1")
  }
}
```

If you are using Maven or older Gradle, you need to specify the correct artifact for your platform, e.g.:
* `org.jetbrains:markdown-jvm:0.6.1` for the JVM version
* `org.jetbrains:markdown-js:0.6.1` for the JS version

### Using `intellij-markdown` for parsing and generating HTML

One of the goals of this project is to provide flexibility in terms of the tasks being solved.
[Markdown Plugin][markdown-plugin] for JetBrains IDEs is an example of a usage when Markdown processing is done
in several stages:

1. Parse block structure without parsing inlines to provide lazy parsable blocks for IDE
2. Quickly parse inlines of a given block to provide faster syntax highlighting update
3. Generate HTML for preview

These tasks may be completed independently according to the current needs. 

#### Simple html generation (Kotlin)

```kotlin
val src = "Some *Markdown*"
val flavour = CommonMarkFlavourDescriptor()
val parsedTree = MarkdownParser(flavour).buildMarkdownTreeFromString(src)
val html = HtmlGenerator(src, parsedTree, flavour).generateHtml()
```

#### Simple html generation (Java)

```java
final String src = "Some *Markdown*";
final MarkdownFlavourDescriptor flavour = new GFMFlavourDescriptor();
final ASTNode parsedTree = new MarkdownParser(flavour).buildMarkdownTreeFromString(text);
final String html = new HtmlGenerator(src, parsedTree, flavour, false).generateHtml();
```

## Development gotchas

The only non-Kotlin files are `.flex` lexer definitions.
They are used for generating lexers, which are the first stage of inline elements parsing. 
Unfortunately, due to bugs, native `java->kt` conversion crashes for these files.
Because of that, conversion from `.flex` to respective Kotlin files requires some manual steps:

1. Install [Grammar Kit](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6606-grammar-kit) plugin. It should be suggested on the opening of any `.flex` file.
2. Install [`jflexToKotlin`](https://github.com/valich/jflexToKotlin) plugin (you will need to build it and then install it manually, via settings). 
3. Run `Run JFlex Generator` action while having `.flex` file opened.
   * On the first run, a dialog will open, suggesting to place to download JFlex - select the project root, then delete excessively downloaded `.skeleton` file.
4. A respective `_<SomeName>Lexer.java` will be generated somewhere. Move it near the existing `_<SomeName>Lexer.kt`.
5. Delete the `.kt` lexer.
6. Run `Convert JFlex Lexer to Kotlin` action while having the new `.java` file opened.
7. Fix the small problems such as imports in the generated `.kt` file. There should be no major issues. Please try to minimize the number of changes to the generated files. This is needed for keeping a clean Git history. 

# Parsing algorithm

The parsing process is held in two logical parts:

1. Splitting the document into blocks of logical structure (lists, blockquotes, paragraphs, etc.)
2. Parsing the inline structure of the resulting blocks

This is the same way as the one being proposed by the [Commonmark spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.16/#appendix-a-a-parsing-strategy).

### Building the logical structure

Each (future) node (list, list item, blockquote, etc.) is associated with the so-called _[marker-block]_.
The rollback-free parsing algorithm is processing every token in the file, one by one.
Tokens are passed to the opened marker blocks, and each block chooses whether to either:

- do nothing
- drop itself
- complete itself

The _[marker-processor]_ stores the blocks, executes the actions chosen by the blocks, and, possibly, adds some new ones.

### Parsing inlines

For the sake of speed and parsing convenience, the text is passed to the [lexer] first.
Then the resulting set of tokens is processed in a special way.

Some inline constructs in Markdown have priorities, i.e., if two different ones overlap, the parsing result depends on their types, not their positions - e.g. ``` *code, `not* emph` ``` and ``` `code, *not` emph* ``` are both code spans + literal asterisks.
This means that normal recursive parsing is inapplicable.

Still, the parsing of inline elements is quite straightforward.
For each inline construct, there is a particular _[sequential-parser]_ which accepts some input text and returns:

1. The parsed ranges found in this text;
2. The sub-text(s), which are to be passed to the subsequent inline parsers.

### Building AST

After building the logical structure and parsing inline elements, a set of ranges corresponding to some markdown entities (i.e. nodes) is given. 
In order to work with the results effectively, it ought to be converted to
the [AST].

As a result, a root [ast-node] corresponding to the parsed Markdown document is returned. 
Each AST node has its own type which is called [`IElementType`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/IElementType.kt) as in the IntelliJ Platform.

### Generating HTML

For a given AST root, a special [visitor][visitor-pattern] to generate the resulting HTML is created. 
Using a given mapping from `IElementType` to the [`GeneratingProvider`][generating-provider] it processes the parsed tree in [Depth-First order][DFS], generating HTML pieces for on each node visit. 

## Extending the parser

Many routines in the above process can be extended or redefined by creating a different [Markdown flavour][markdown-flavours].
The minimal default flavour is [CommonMark] which is implemented in this project. 

[GitHub Flavoured Markdown][GFM] is an example of extending CommonMark flavour implementation. 
It can be used as a [reference](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/flavours/gfm/GFMFlavourDescriptor.kt) for implementing your own Markdown features.

## API

* [`MarkdownFlavourDescriptor`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/flavours/MarkdownFlavourDescriptor.kt) is a base class for extending the Markdown parser.

    * [`markerProcessorFactory`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/parser/MarkerProcessorFactory.kt)
        is responsible for block structure customization.

        * `stateInfo` value allows to use a state during document parsing procedure.

          `updateStateInfo(pos: LookaheadText.Position)` is called at the beginning of each position processing

        * `populateConstraintsTokens` is called to create nodes for block structure markers at the beginning
          of the lines (for example, `>` characters constituting blockquotes)

        * [`getMarkerBlockProviders`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/parser/markerblocks/MarkerBlockProvider.kt)
            is a place to (re)define types of block structures

    * [`sequentialParserManager`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/parser/sequentialparsers/SequentialParserManager.kt)

        `getParserSequence` defines inlines parsing procedure. The method must return a list of SequentialParsers
        where the earliest parsers have the biggest operation precedence. For example, to parse code spans and emphasis elements with the correct priority, the list should be `[CodeSpanParser, EmphParser]` but not the opposite.

        [`SequentialParser`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/parser/sequentialparsers/SequentialParser.kt) has only one method:

        `parse(tokens: TokensCache, rangesToGlue: List<IntRange>): ParsingResult`
        * `tokens` is a special holder for the tokens returned by lexer
        * `rangesToGlue` is a list of ranges in the document which are to be searched for the structures in question.

          Considering the input: ``A * emph `code * span` b * c `` for the emph parser ranges
          [`A * emph `, ` b * c`] mean that emph must be searched in the input `A * emph | b * c`.

          The method must essentially return the parsing result (nodes for the found structures) and the parts
          of the text to be given to the next parsers.

          Considering the same input for the code span parser the result would be `` `code * span` ``
          of the type "code span" and the delegate pieces would be [`A * emph `, ` b * c`].

    * [`createInlinesLexer`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/lexer/MarkdownLexer.kt) should return the lexer to split the text
      to the tokens before inline parsing procedure run.

    * [`createHtmlGeneratingProviders(linkMap: LinkMap, baseURI: URI?)`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/html/GeneratingProvider.kt)
      is the place where generated HTML is customized. This method should return a map which defines how to handle
      the particular kinds of the nodes in the resulting tree.

      `linkMap` here is precalculated information about the links defined in the document with the means of
      link definition. `baseURI` is the URI to be considered the base path for the relative links resolving.
      For example, given `baseUri='/user/repo-name/blob/master'` the link `foo/bar.png` should be transformed to
      the `/user/repo-name/blob/master/foo/bar.png`.

      Each returned provider must implement `processNode(visitor: HtmlGenerator.HtmlGeneratingVisitor, text: String, node: ASTNode)`
      where 
      * `text` is the whole document being processed,
      * `node` is the node being given to the provider,
      * `visitor` is a special object responsible for the HTML generation.
        See [`GeneratingProviders.kt`](src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/html/GeneratingProviders.kt) for the samples.
