1. This is ordered list' item
2. And another
1991. And one more
1986\. And this is not
1 Also this is not
And this 1. is also not a list

Let's look at the indentation:

1. This is the item
    * And this is subitem

        (It has some text indented)

            And this *code* has the indent of 12 to be code

        That's the story

    * As well as this one

    And some text in here, which related to the ordered 1. item.

        So the indent of 8 is enough now to be the +code+

2. The second item in here!!

        And it contains some code, indented at 8

    That's all folks!
